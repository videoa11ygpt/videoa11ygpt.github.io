She starts by scooping out the red flesh of a halved watermelon, leaving the white rind. Using a melon baller, she removes the remaining red flesh to expose more of the white rind. Next, she peels off the green skin with a knife, slices the rind into strips, and then cuts them into smaller pieces. The rind pieces are placed in a bowl and salt is sprinkled over them. In a separate bowl, she combines garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, chopped green onion, and honey to create a paste. This paste is then mixed with the salted rind. The woman mixes everything thoroughly by hand, ensuring the rind is well-coated with the paste. Finally, she tastes the prepared watermelon rind kimchi with chopsticks, expressing satisfaction with the result."
