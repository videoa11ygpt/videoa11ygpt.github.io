Red spheres, depicting ions, are connected by springs to a brown horizontal bar above. When the spacing of the ion crystal matches the optical lattice, the ions exhibit maximum friction, causing them to stick and then release in unison, which dissipates energy. Conversely, when the spacing is mismatched, the friction reduces, and the ions glide smoothly along the lattice in a synchronized, caterpillar-like motion."
